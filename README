Project Name: KD Tree
Author: Tyler Smith
Class: CS 315

Purpose: This program takes in user input of n points, of k dimensions.
	 The program stores these values and then makes a balanced offline KD Tree.
	 The user also gives the program a certain number of probes.
	 These probes are then printed along with the bucket of points they would belong to.

How it Works: The program stores all the points into a 2D vector.
	      These points are then inserted into a KD Tree by first finding the best dimension to discrimante on.
	      The median of the points based on the dimension is found using a quick select algorithm.
              The vector of points is then split into two vectors based on the median value.
	      The program recurs down the tree until the vector size is less than or equal to 10.
	      These points are then stored in the leaf nodes of the tree.
